    attribute and property:
    You may get confuseing in SELinux Document:
    > Policy attributes identify as groups sets of security types that have a similar property

    But how difference betwen two words??

    ```
    In Computer Sciences,Those are two different word.
    Property is a quality that exists without any attribution.Like metals is electrical conductivity
    or the man is boy/girl

    attribute is a quality or object that we attribute to someone or something. 
    For example, the scepter is an attribute of power and statehood
    ```
    But In general terms (and in normal English usage) the terms mean the same thing.
