It's easier to run

Replacing this pain with something numb

It's so much easier to go

Than face all this pain here all alone


\{

If I could change I would take back the pain I would

Retrace every wrong move that I made I would

If I could stand up and take the blame I would

I would take all my shame to the grave

\}
